        <p className="case-header">The Case for Home</p>
        <p className="case case-for-home"> There are currently 25 million family caregivers in the U.S. Only 8 in 10 people in need of home assistance will find the care they are seeking. Falls are the leading cause of injury related visits to the emergency room. Not to mention, the elderly who fall experience functional decline thereafter. Consumers have grown increasingly frustrated with our fragmented health care system. They have been forced to take on much greater roles in caring for their aging parents, and  become stressed with making critical decisions for their loved ones. So many are overwhelmed and just plain exhausted.
        Sadly, overwhelmed doctors and hospital systems often fall short in assuring continuity and coordination of care. I help families fill these gaps!</p>
        <p className="case right proposal">Are you overwhelmed and considering how to best care for your aging parents?</p>

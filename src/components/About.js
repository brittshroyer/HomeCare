        <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p>Last year, I offered informally to look in on an elderly woman who had just returned home following a hip fracture.  Her children lived far away and wanted peace of mind that the transition would go smoothly and that she would quickly resume her wholly independent lifestyle.  Within one week it became clear that this was going to be the beginning of a journey. One that I delighted in, every step of the way.
        The Home care agency tasked with making daily visits and overseeing her rehabilitation efforts for 30 days was discordant an ineffectual.  I began to untangle webs of unmet needs and juggled the many moving parts of her situation. She was somewhat independent, but clearly needed a reliable support system and ongoing nursing oversight.
        With careful consideration and ongoing communication with her family members we crafted a more comprehensive arrangement and devised a plan of care that addressed both her immediate needs AND and all of her additional health conditions that threatened to undermine her successful recovery.
        Although she transitioned to a nearby assisted living facility and I don't see her as frequently, she remains a dear friend.
        My "journey" with her provided the inspiration to endeavor to continue this type of work. Many families are struggling to keep their loved ones safely cared for at home but find Community resources either lacking or not customized to  fit their particular needs. Some caregivers are just plain exhausted and need a break.
        When children of aging parents notice a gradual loss of independence and begin to feel uncomfortable leaving them alone they usually decide to move them to assisted living.
        this decision can be fraught with buyers remorse if you aren't aware of what the facility CAN'T do.  These facilities are NOT nursing homes with fancy furniture.  If your parent is in very fragile health and seems to be declining, consider that assisted living facilities are considered NON medical facilities and not required by law to have a Registered Nurse on site.  And even if they do, they CANNOT provide hands on skilled care.

          <p>As health care consumers grow increasingly frustrated with our fragmented Health Care system, family care givers have been forced to take on much greater roles in caring for their aged parents and loved ones.
          Overwhelmed Doctors seldom take the time to partner with families; time that could minimize hospitalizations and or institutionalization.  A recent article in my local paper pointed out an uptick in emergency calls to assisted living facilities and private homes of elderly residents. I believe that many of these calls could be avoided with ongoing comprehensive nursing visits for the purpose of identifying impending problems and intervening before a situations becomes urgent or life threatening
          I can bridge the gaps in healthcare and help families maximize the quality of life of individuals with simple or complicated acute and chronic illnesses, all in the privacy of their home or assisted facility.

          <p>My mission is to enhance the lives of the elderly by delivering professional nursing care and advocacy services that allow them to maintain an independent dignified lifestyle.</p>
